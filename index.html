						<p class="intro">
							The ancient city of Akrágas was a Greek Colony founded on Sicily’s southwestern coast over
							2600 years ago. Originally named for a nearby river by colonists from Gela, Crete and
							Rhodes, it
							is known today as Agrigento and the former site is referred to as “Valle dei Templi”
							<em>(Italian)</em>, "Vaddi di li Tempri" <em>(Sicilian)</em> or “The Valley of Temples” — a
							slight misrepresentation considering it’s positioned on a plateau and ridge across two
							hills.
						</p>
						<p>
							Akrágas was an important center of Greek civilisation and even referred to by Virgil in his
							classic work, <em>Aeneid</em>. Ruled by a series of tyrants, Akrágas reached great political
							power in
							480 BCE with the military defeat of Carthage at The Battle of Himera. This led to a period
							of
							construction of many of the city’s remarkable temples and a population boom of 200,000
							people. The noted philosopher Empedocles wrote of his city’s residents, <em>"...they party as if
						they will die tomorrow, and build as if they will live for ever."</em> But after 75 years the
							building came to a stop. Carthage exacted its revenge on Akrágas, sacking and abandoning the
							great city.
						</p>
						<p>
							Over the next two centuries Akrágas was repopulated, rebuilt and recaptured — first by the
							returning Carthaginians, and then by the Romans who renamed it as the Latin equivalent
							“Agrigentum”. Roman Rule brought flourishing trade to the city’s port but also imposed
							slavery
							on the many of the city’s inhabitants. After the Fall of the Roman Empire, the area
							depopulated,
							becoming a shadow of its former glory. It was little more than a village when Arab rule
							spread across Sicily in the 9th Century.

					<h3 class="red temple-intro-title">The Temples</h3>
					<p>
						The temples of Akrágas may have once numbered as many as ten at the height of the city.
						Today,
						seven were known
						to have existed, a few of which still stand. Each temple is dedicated to a different Greek
						deity
						and built
						of sandstone in the Doric style. The temples are now commonly referred to using the
						Roman/Latin
						naming conventions.
					</p>
					<p>
						As an oligarchy, Akrágas saw a series of tyrants at its helm. The tyrant Theron called for a
						massive
						building campaign following the city’s victory over the Cathaginians in the 5th Century BCE
						and
						many of the
						temples were built during the century that followed. These structures have endured and
						amazed
						for over two
						thousand years. In 1787, German author Goethe wrote: <em>“Such a splendid springtime view as today's at sunrise
			we've never had in our whole lives. On the site of the old and Ancient Citadel… towards the southern end of this green and blossoming terrain does one spot The Temple Of Concordia rising
			above it, as well as to the East the scant remains of The Temple Of Juno”.</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to these temples, Akrágas boasted other architectural wonders throughout its
						extended history
						including the city’s port “Porto Empedocle”, the pyramidical “Tomb of Theron” which was
						likely
						built to
						commemorate Roman casualties in the Second Punic War and the grand villas of
						Hellenistic-Roman
						style built
						for the city’s wealthiest residents.

							<p>One of the best preserved temples in the world, the Temple of Concordia
