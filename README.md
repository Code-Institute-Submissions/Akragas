## First Milestone Project for Code Institute Diploma in Fullstack Web Development

***

For over two thousand years the city of Akrágas, now known as Agrigento or The Valley of Temples, has **astounded visitors**.<br>
And yet many people are still unaware of its existence!<br>

The Akrágas webite seeks to introduce Akrágas to a wider audience.<br>
Using evocative, representative images and video; interesting facts, quotes and historical context, as well a direct link to booking site - this website will connect people to the place <br>

As someone with ties to the ancient city *(my grandafather and our ancestors are from the area)* I am passionate about sharing this remarkable location with the world and hope that Akrágas, Agrigento and the island of Sicily can enjoy increased and ongoing interest from tourists, historians and adventure seekers alike.
