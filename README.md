# Akrágas Website
## First Milestone Project for Code Institute Diploma in Fullstack Web Development

***

For over two thousand years the city of Akrágas, now known as Agrigento or The Valley of Temples, has astounded visitors.<br>
And yet many people are still unaware of its existence!<br>

The Akrágas webite seeks to introduce Akrágas to a wider audience.<br>
Using evocative, representative images and video; interesting facts, quotes and historical context, as well a direct link to booking site - this website will connect people to the place <br>

As someone with ties to the ancient city (my grandafather and our ancestors are from the area) I am passionate about sharing this remarkable location with the world and hope that Akrágas, Agrigento and the island of Sicily can enjoy ongoing interest from tourists, historians and adventure seekers alike.
